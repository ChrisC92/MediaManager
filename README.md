# MediaManager

Tracks series that have been saved onto the users computer where the user can set current episode, this information is stored where there are two list options of the series that are currently on the file and also ones that have previously been deleted

# Getting Starting

Run the program and then in file click open, specify the file path to your series folder, the series should show as a list in the main screen of the GUI

# Things To Note
This applicaiton isn't smart enough to automatically group together a series if there are seperate series directories within a folder, so its best to have all the episodes grouped under the one directory.
