# MediaManager

Tracks series that have been saved onto the users computer where the user can set current episode, this information is stored where there are two list options of the series that are currently on the file and also ones that have previously been deleted.

Run from the src/GUI/MainApp class

# Things To Note
This applicaiton isn't smart enough to automatically group together a series if there are seperate series directories within a folder, so its best to have all the episodes grouped under the one directory.
